The Assembly is pretty simple.

The ejection gears and motor can be left as they are. In the example shown, a pen cap is what the gear interfaced with. The potnetiometer was attached to the top of this. 

A metal tray from inside the DVD drive was hammered into a bracket, a small piece of wood was then attached to match the height of the potentiometer. This creates the main structure of the servo.
